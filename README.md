### Introduction
This is my game project for INT2215 Advanced Programming course at UET. This game is a simple 2D game, which is a clone of the famous game `Chicken Invaders Universe`. The game is written in C++ programming language with SDL2 library. I wrote this entire game on Linux(Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Linux 5.19.0-40-generic x86_64) with Visual Studio Code IDE. This project is configed for GNU/Linux, with the windows OS, please reconfig the makefile correctly.
